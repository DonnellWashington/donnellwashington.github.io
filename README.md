### Education
Clemson University - Computer Science 2022-2027

### Work Experience
Coding Instructor Intern - Beaufort Digital Corridor 2020-2022
- Designed and developed interactive coding projects (games, apps) to engage students in software development.
- Enhanced communication and leadership skills by mentoring students in group and one-on-one settings.

### Projects
Extended Connect 4
- Worked in a team to design and develop an extended version of the Connect 4 Game that runs with a command-line interface. Unlike the classic Connect 4 game, the game implemented through Java allow users to choose dynamic board sizes, customize the difficulty through changes win requirements, and provides options for more than 2 players. The game also offers both a fast and memory-efficient version to enhance player experience. Adhering to industry-standard tools and practices, the project focused on creating a robust, scalable, and user-friendly version of the classic Connect 4 game. During this project, I contributed to both the development and optimization processes, learning how to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

  ## Code Snippets
![](Assets/2DArray.PNG)

This first image shows the fast implementation for the connect 4 game. Using a 2D array to display the spaces on the board. Although this method is convenient it isn't memory efficient as spaces are generated even when unoccupied. 

![](Assets/gameboardMem.PNG)

On the contrary this second image uses a hash map to store the spaces and tokens. This method is better for users who don't have a lot of memory. This is because the spaces don't exist until they are occupied by a token and therefore the spaces that remain empty do not take up memory.

### Technical Skills
Tools - Visual Studio, Android Studio, Linux, IntelliJ, Vim, emacs

Technologies - Git/GitHub

Languages - C/C++, Java, Python, x86-64 Assembly
